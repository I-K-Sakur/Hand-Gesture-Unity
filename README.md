# Hand-Gesture-Unity
 
This project focuses on developing a vision-based interaction system in Unity, where a robot responds to human gestures captured by a camera. The system will use computer vision algorithms to detect and interpret gestures, enabling intuitive control of the robot. The project emphasizes real-time processing and seamless interaction between the user and the robot in a virtual environment.
